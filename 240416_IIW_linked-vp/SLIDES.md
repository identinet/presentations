## Public Data

notes:

- What is the linked-vp spec about? Verifiable Data and Verifiable Credentials
- Something we come across every day
  - On Websites
  - On the walls of company headquarters
- Organizations and people claim all kinds of things on websites and social
  networks
- Legally relevant information is presented to us, like terms of use, privacy
  policies, imprint data etc.
- And I ask myself? Is this information authorized, is this information
  authentic and does is it unmodified?
- Someone put the information on the website, only the org has the password, so
  it must be an authorized piece of data

### Examples of org public data

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 items-center">

- Organizational data on imprint pages
- Terms of Use, Privacy Policies
- Partner logos
- Certifications
- Endorsed initiatives and services

</div>

### Examples of personal public data

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 items-center">

- contact details
- Work experience
- Education
- Achievements and Awards

<figure>
  <img src="./linkedin.png" class="shadow-md" />

### Challenges

<div class="grid grid-cols-2">
<div>
<span class="underline">Malicious activities</span>

- Fraud
- Misrepresentation
- Misattribution

</div>
<div>
<span class="underline">High effort</span>

- Duplication of data in processes
- Discoverability
- Verification

</div>
</div>

notes:

- All the claims that are made online, come with a lot of challenges
- Malicious uses of data are decreasing the experience on the web for everyone
- Figuring out malicious schemes is difficult and it starts with first of all
  discovering data and verifying data to make sense of its contents
- The good thing is that with DIDs and VCs we have technologies that provide
  identity and data attribution and are well suited for the decentralized web

## DIF Linked Verifiable Presentation Spec

[identity.foundation/linked-vp](https://identity.foundation/linked-vp)

Authors: Brian Richter, Markus Sabadello, Jan Christoph Ebersbach

notes:

- This got me thinking about how to DIDs and VCs could be used to make public
  data verifiable
- In the Identifiers and Discovery WG of DIF
- Brian Richter, Markus Sabadello and I teamed to create the Linked Verifiable
  Presentation specification

### What is specified?

- Just a new type for service endpoints, `LinkedVerifiablePresentation`

```json [3,9-11]
"context": {
  "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/contexts/v1"
}
...
"service": [
  {
    "id": "did:example:123#foo",
    "type": "LinkedVerifiablePresentation",
    "serviceEndpoint":
      "https://foo.example.com/presentation.json"
  },
```

notes:

- The spec just defines a new type for service endpoints
- And requires the link to point to a Verifiable Presentation document

### What is Not specified?

  <thead><tr><th>Topic</th><th>Alternative</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>

<!-- </div> -->

notes:

- Any DID method is supported, as long as it supports the modification of
  service endpoints. TODO: maybe add this to the spec?
- The protocol for retrieving the presentations is not specified and up for
  implementors to define. HTTP is an obvious choice, ipfs could also be used for
  additional intergrity guarantees.
- Any storage medium can be used in the background, from a file on the
  filesystem to databases and blockchains
- The spec does not define how presentations actually get to the location and
  how they are updated.
  - The Credential Registry specification by EECC/GS1 defines a comprehensive
    service API. The two specs are not yet compatible
  - Our aim was to focus the spec on publicly connecting verifiable data a DID
    so that it can be retrieved by end users/interested parties, rather than
    providing a full service specifiction for implementors
- The spec also doesn't define how a DID is connected to a website

## How to use it on the Web?

<small>

1. Link DID to website
   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Combine multiple Verifiable Credentials into a Verifiable Presentation
   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Publish signed presentation at URL <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. Extend DID document with service endpoint of type
   LinkedVerifiablePresentation <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. Website visitors will be able to discover and verify data
   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

</small>

```json [3,9-11]
"context": {
  "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
  "https://identity.foundation/linked-vp/contexts/v1"
}
...
"service": [
  {
    "id": "did:example:123#foo",
    "type": "LinkedVerifiablePresentation",
    "serviceEndpoint":
      "https://foo.example.com/presentation.json"
  },
```

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes:

-
- Why do we need it when there are DIDComm and OpenID4VC? What would the world
  be like if we had public verifiable data?
- Seeing it in action
  - Implementing it, just embed the simple context, add to DID, issue and share
    credentials
  - Public credential sharing has limitations that people need to be aware of
- Use Cases people came up with

### Use Cases

<div class="fragment">
  <div class="i-fa6-solid-triangle-exclamation color-[var(--lightSecondary1)] h-[1em] w-[1em] inline-block"></div>
  Not suitable for all data!
</div>

- Verifiable imprint page
- Automated Masterdata Management
- Verifiable partner endorsements / memberships
- Decentralized business network à la LinkedIn
- Digital Product Passports
